        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>On April 13, 2014, God our Father, Jesus our Savior, and the Holy Spirit our Comforter: 
        Christ Centered Living Water Ministries was called into existence.  
        God Almighty commanded Pastors Alphonso and Portia Paulk to build a church without walls
        and He will build the people through the obedience of Pastors Paulk.  
        Pastor Gloria C. Bennett was appointed by the Lord as Pastoral overseer for spiritual guidance, prayer, and counseling for Pastors Paulk.
         <br><br>
        CCLW Ministries started with Brother Alphonso Paulk, Jr., 
        Brother Leonard and Sister Veronica Crawford, Sister Charlene Minor, Sister Shelia Jones, 
        Sister Marie Henderson and her six sons, and Sister Marissa Emanuel and her three brothers, Justin, Jacare, and Kevin.  Elder Huff and Mother Huff joined interim to provide spiritual wisdom and prayer.
        <br><br>
        Sister Veronica took over the Praise Team in the absence of Sister Charlene, 
        and what a mighty God we serve through the anointing He has placed upon her leadership.  
        The Praise Team consists of Sister Veronica, Deacon Leonard, Brother AJ and Sister Marissa.  
        Brother Leonard served as Deacon.  Brother Raymond and Raheem served as Ushers.
         <br><br>
        CCLW has truly been blessed to have such faithful members.  
        The Lord led us to our current location at 4026 East Lake Parkway, McDonough.  
        This location is “temporary.”
         <br><br>
        CCLW has no doubt experienced some growing pains, 
        we rejoice in the Lord always for the good, as well as the not so good.  
        We look forward to many more years.</p>
