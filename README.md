# Church Website
This is an uncompleted website. I was asked by my church to create a website for them. 
It's been since June 2016, since the last time I touched the code and looked at the site.
The site isn't currently up and has long been forgotten. 
For multiple reasons I had to shut down the production of the site for my first clients.
I figured it would be great for me to take a look back at where I started, fix all issues and redo the entire site design.
This should be fun and also a challenge. Feel free to clone and pitch in.

## How to view the site
As of now, the site is easy to view just download the repository (or clone it) and open the "home.html" file.
I may add more technology and test out different tools later. If any changes occur the README file will be updated.
